The owner of the house rents the property to a large group of ever changing occupants. The facade had been previously painted and was chipping so it was replaced by an amateur contractor using bathroom tiles. Needless to say, half of the bathroom tiles have fallen off of the front of the property. Many of the tiles are strewn on the sidewalk in pieces for months until they are removed. The neighbors of this block would like the owner of the property to upgrade the facade using proper materials and traditional means and maintain the property.

Is it possible to add additional parking in this area? I am unsure of the original reason for not having the parking signs extend further but an additional car would definitely not provide a line of site problem with traffic coming down 4th street and I don't believe a second car would either as both would be well away from the intersection. The only other reason I could think of for this being here would be turning radius for larger vehicles however since both sides of the street along 4th street across from the mint are no parking zones turning radius wouldn't be an issue for even a tractor trailer or the more likely garbage truck.

I called Verizon Repair and confirmed an appointment with a Verizon Repairman for Thursday morning (5/16). Verizon Repairman discovered that the Contractor building the 6 new townhouses at 501 S12th Street (originally a single structure known as “The Pain Center”) cut the Verizon Telephone/DSL Cable that serviced the 12 townhouse structure on the South side of the 1100 Block of Lombard Street (1124, 1124.5, 1126, 1126.5, 1128, 1128.5, 1130, 1130.5, 1132, 1132.5, 1134, 1134.5). Verizon Cable Repair was called in and restored service to our townhouses by Thursday afternoon. I was very impress with the quick restoration of service Verizon provided.\nNow I’m very concerned about our other services like Electric, Gas, & Water. All are supplied to our 12 townhouse structure below ground. There used to be a 4foot void between Our Townhouse Structure and the old “Pain Center” Structure. Since that was the location where the contractor cut the Verizon Cable, I suspect our other services come from there as well. I suspect that that 4 foot void was a “Service Right-of-way”. The contractor has since taken over that 4foot void and has been digging and riding heavy construction vehicles there.\nI spoke to the Verizon Cable Repair Team asking them if they were ever called to flag their cable on that property. They stated No.\nHas the contractor working on 501 S12th Street called PA’s one call system “Stop—Call Before You Dig! 800-242-1776” ?"},{"id":"118690","request_type_id":"4133","lat":"39.928135","long":"-75.162894","date_created":"1368972531","status":"received","slug":"large-pothole-118690","title":"pothole","image":null,"address":"1027 WATKINS ST","location":"Philadelphia, PA, USA                             ","count_supporters":"1","description":"There is a large pothole on the north side of Watkins Street, in front of 1027 Watkins Street, specifically.

This skating rink attracts crowds from all over the city, more often, the wrong crowds who come from worse parts of town.  When the night at the rink is over, crowds cause mass confusion and danger crossing across the Boulevard, have thrown debris at cars, and in some instances have assaulted people from the neighborhood.  They gather in front of the properties as they wait on the buses, in which they cause more problems.  They litter and destroy yards, fences, etc. mine included.  This activity has gotten so bad over the years, that police needs to have an air and ground presence to stop it, yet the crowds move from one location to the other, similar to the tactics drug dealers use when a block gets too hot.  Speaking of drug dealers, I understand such unsavory activity also occurs within the skating rink where people are selling and distributing drugs and such.  YET - the city cracks down on the homeowners as they issue quality of life warnings (notwithstanding, bogus property reassessments to steal even more money from responsible homeowners) due to the destruction of these crowds, when the obvious source is the nuisance business establishment which attracts these crowds and the cities ineffectiveness at quelling these types of problems.  I'm sick of being blamed and paying for everyone's negligence -  this goes from public servants, to the business owners, to the crowds themselves and this needs to end starting with shutting down and suing the establishment.  I am not to be reprimanded because of your ineffectiveness and others blatant disrespect - that is why neighborhoods go to waste and is a primary reason why this neighborhood may suffer that same fate.  Or, is that your intent because your long term city plans have ambitious visions for the use of the Roosevelt Boulevard and you WANT to DRIVE out the homeowners?  How can I go about filing civil complaints and other similar things against this business and the city so that my property won't get destroyed and I won't be blamed and targeted by the city who just wants to drive me from my home while stealing my money in the process?\n"},{"id":"101492","request_type_id":"4403","lat":"39.964485","long":"-75.161175","date_created":"1364596759","status":"received","slug":"certificate-of-occupancy-101492","title":"Certificate of Occupancy","image":null,"address":"1410 MOUNT VERNON ST","location":"Philadelphia, PA, USA                             ","count_supporters":"1","description":"We are in need of a copy of our CO, could you please direct us to the appropriate department/phone number?

I parked in the last legal spot on the right side (west side) of 23rd Street, just north of the intersection with Green.  I left my car at exactly 930 AM to attend the pre-mass viewing.  I know the time precisely because I was parked in a 2 hour zone and I wanted to be sure I got back in time after the 1030 mass to avoid a citation.\nI returned to my vehicle at 1125 AM.  A Phila Street Dept crew of four had blocked 23rd Street and were in the process of JACKHAMMERING the asphalt road service, parallel to the parked vehicles.  They had jackhammered within 1 foot of the entire left side of my car!  Please note there were NO signs indicating that there was going to be road construction.  When I brought the situation to the attention of the road crew they acted with disdain.  They asked if it was my car.  Asked if I wanted to pull out of the parking spot.  When I said \"you are jackhammering right next to my car\" no one seemed to care.  Certainly no one apologized.  The vehicle has small pock marks along the lower half of the left side.  Some of the marks are dents.  In some of the other spots the paint is missing, spots smaller than a dime.  Am I supposed to sue you to re-paint my car?  What gives with the City?  My vehicle was not the only vehicle getting this treatment.  I would hope that someone from the City would contact me and somehow make this right.

According to the Philadelphia city ordinance, (Bill No. 050749) which I have attached to this email, Section 2, 10-403, (10), (b), states that: \n“No anti-theft or anti-intruder alarm system siren, whether for a home or a vehicle,  shall sound, either continuously or intermittently, for a course of more than 15 minutes or for more than 15 minutes in a one hour period.”  \n\nThe vehicle in violation of this ordinance is a newer model red Ford Explorer with PA license plate FLN 3055 and a Free Mason plate on the front.  The vehicle is parked on the southwest corner of Larchwood Avenue and 51st Street facing east. It is has been parked there and has not moved for over 2 weeks. \n\nBoth my wife and a tenant who rents a room in our home have called 911, 311, and the 18th Precinct several times over the last week at times ranging from 8 or 9pm to as early as 5 or 6am. We are to the point that we cannot sleep at night and have been forced to relocate to other parts of our home and sleep on an air mattress in a desperate attempt to escape the sounds of the loud and disruptive car alarm going off every single night.  \n\nI appreciate any help and swift resolution to this disturbance. \n\n\n"},{"id":"94729","request_type_id":"4147","lat":"39.924382","long":"-75.230967","date_created":"1361330589","status":"in progress","slug":"drug-house-94729","title":"Drug House","image":"ptlmwbzwvm","address":"06404 GLENMORE AVE","location":"Philadelphia, PA, USA                             ","count_supporters":"2","description":"Please seal upstairs windows.

Four African-American youths (12-14 years old) were biking on the Kelly Drive about a mile west of Boathouse Row and were somewhat antagonistic (e. g.  biking to close to runners, threatening stares, etc.) When our run was over, I learned that one of the youths had assaulted one of our female friends who'd been walking on the path by slapping her on the rear. I encouraged her to file a police report, but she wasn't hurt and doesn't have the time  to go through the process of going to a station and waiting to file a report. She tried calling, but was told she would have to personally go in to the station. \n\nShe and I agree that it'd be virtually impossible to catch the kids at this point, but we think it's important that authorities are aware of these types of incidents so that if patterns develop resources can be assigned to potential problem areas. \n\nPlease advise if you have a suggestion for reporting this sort of thing other than filing an in-person police report."},{"id":"68007","request_type_id":"4133","lat":"39.951366","long":"-75.168079","date_created":"1347630153","status":"in progress","slug":"pothole-repair-68007","title":"Pothole Repair","image":null,"address":"1622 CHESTNUT ST","location":"Philadelphia, PA, USA                             ","count_supporters":"1","description":"17 and samson very large indent adjacent to Pedestrian crossing.
